# Economic Applications of Data Science

In Fall 2024, I am teaching Econ 370: Economic Applications of Data Science. The materials for this course draw heavily from Alex Marsh's version of Econ 370. 

The course provides a broad-based introduction to numerical and data science methods commonly used in economics.
