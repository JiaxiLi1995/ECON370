# Economic Applications of Data Science

In Fall 2025, I am teaching Econ 370: Economic Applications of Data Science. The materials for this course draw heavily from Drew Van Kuikan and Alex Marsh's version of Econ 370. One can find Drew's version here: https://github.com/drewvankuiken/ECON370.

The course provides a broad-based introduction to numerical and data science methods commonly used in economics.
